<div>
    <p>Dear {0},</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for your registration with St Andrews Research Repository. You have been authorised to submit into the Library Theses collection. 
        Once your submission is complete, repository staff will move your submission to the appropriate collection.
    </p>
    <p>Please return to the Login page at <a href="https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/ldap-login">https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/ldap-login</a> 
        where you can log in again to the repository.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>From the right-hand Browse menu, go to Submissions under ‘My Account’ where, having selected your collection from the drop-down menu, 
            you can then make your submission.
        </li>
        <li>Please fill in as many details as you can about your thesis, including the abstract. Please also provide subject keywords to describe 
            your work more fully.
        </li>
        <li>Please grant the deposit license on the final submission page in order to submit your work into the repository.</li>
        <li>You are also given the choice to attach a Creative Commons license to your work if you wish to. On the License Your Work page, 
            if you choose this option from the License Type: dropdown menu, we recommend that you choose a restrictive license and answer 
            No to both questions; "Allow commercial uses of your work?" and " Allow modifications of your work?".
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a link to the Creative Commons site where you can see more information about the choice of licenses offered. 
        You may want to be less restrictive or not choose this option at all - the choice is yours. 
        Your work is covered by original copyright whether or not you attach this license.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck with your deposit and we will acknowledge receipt and confirm the citation to your electronic thesis, 
        once both your print and electronic copies have been processed.
    </p>
    <p>If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us again.</p>
